## Course Learning Objectives

TODO: Review the [course learning objectives](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-101-fall-2024/course-materials?tab=readme-ov-file#course-learning-objectives).


### Record three learning objectives for which you judge you can demonstrate mastery of the technical knowledge or skill

#### Restate the first learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

#### Restate the second learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

#### Restate the third learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

### Give a learning objective that you have improved on since the last module of the course

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain what you did to improve your knowledge

### Give a learning objective that connects to covered material but for which you must continue to work

TODO: Retype the learning objective and the explain what work you need to
complete so as to ensure that you can develop a mastery of the stated technical skill
